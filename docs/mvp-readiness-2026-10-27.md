# Gombey AI MVP readiness

Status snapshot: 2026-10-27. This is a validation checklist, not a claim that
the service is ready for unrestricted production use.

## Proposed first-sale boundary

The safest initial offer is one dedicated customer deployment, with separate
admin/member accounts, an admin-managed shared knowledge agent, private member
chats, and a customer-owned model-provider account. This is not pooled
multi-tenant SaaS, a shared inbox, local inference, or an autonomous workflow
platform. The customer and the VPS operator remain privileged administrators
of their infrastructure.

Do not accept customer data or promise a production deployment until the
following cloud-workspace gates pass.

## Verified locally

- The customer deployment preflight now fails closed on a missing or
  mode-insecure `.env`, invalid or reserved hostnames/email, missing provider
  configuration, weak/malformed/duplicate deployment secrets, unsafe public
  registration/password-reset settings, and unexpected host-published ports.
- `scripts/test_customer_init.sh` passes.
- `scripts/test_customer_preflight.sh` passes, including invalid hostname,
  reserved domain, short-secret, and duplicate-secret cases.
- `python3 scripts/test_set_rag_embeddings_key.py` passes (6 tests).
- The customer Compose template parses successfully; the sample `.env` emits
  expected warnings for unset provider fields. A real API credential and live
  provider response are not validated by that parse check.
- A separate local staging deployment is loopback-only. Local browser checks
  covered an admin and member, shared-agent Viewer access, private member
  chats/files, and denial of member edits to shared-agent instructions/source.
- An isolated second deployment used separate secrets, network, database, and
  storage; a synthetic marker was absent across deployments. An isolated
  restore drill also completed.
- Three generated synthetic evaluation manuals are 31, 36, and 31 pages. Their
  covers, representative interior pages, and final pages were visually
  inspected. The evaluator answer key is separate and must not be uploaded as
  knowledge.
- A low-cost OpenRouter Qwen smoke test answered a synthetic chat for one
  disposable user. A second account without a provider key did not inherit the
  first account's key. This does not prove retrieval or tool calling through
  Qwen.

## Remaining go/no-go gates for the cloud workspace

1. Repeat grounded retrieval/citation as a second member with the agreed
   customer-owned provider/embedding credentials. Confirm the result and usage
   appear under the intended customer billing account. Do not use Gombey's or
   the owner's subscription/API credentials for customer traffic.
2. Decide whether model keys are per-member BYOK or customer-managed centrally,
   then test the chosen flow end-to-end for both members.
3. Reconcile the public site's read-only-connector claim. The current shared
   agent has File Search only; no MCP/calendar/CRM integration or write-action
   workflow has passed acceptance. Either scope the connector out of the first
   contract or implement and test one named read-only connector before selling
   it as included.
4. Run a Stripe test-mode rehearsal: kickoff payment, accepted-delivery
   payment, saved payment method and explicit recurring-charge consent, first
   subscription charge 30 days after delivery, founding discount, and
   transition to standard price. Live catalog entries alone do not automate
   this lifecycle.
5. Verify a real customer VPS: DNS, HTTPS/TLS, reboot persistence, restricted
   network exposure, backup, restore, and the same account-isolation checks.
   Purchase/production setup requires owner approval of exact plan and spend,
   hostname, and DNS control.

## Separate offer gates

- Workspace Appliance: commission the actual hardware and test power/network
  failure, backup/restore, remote recovery, and replacement/support boundaries.
- Private Local AI: validate inference quality/performance, multi-user access,
  recovery, and actual data paths on the offered workstation. Do not promise
  blanket privacy or performance based on Mac staging.

## Customer-owned inputs before production

- Confirmed hostname and certificate-contact email; customer controls DNS.
- Approved VPS plan/renewal cost and payment method.
- Customer-owned model and embedding credentials, entered through a secure
  path rather than pasted into chat, source, or handoff notes.
- Named customer admin, approved source documents, retention/deletion rules,
  and written scope/acceptance criteria.
- For Appliance/Local: hardware, service area, travel, warranty, and support
  terms agreed in writing.

No VPS purchase, invoice, checkout link, subscription, or customer charge is
created by this readiness work. Do not mark the MVP complete until the
applicable gates above have evidence.
